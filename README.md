# da-rnn
A Dual-Stage Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network for Time Series Prediction

Implements the algorithm described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02971.pdf in Pytorch.
The implementation also includes a Dataset class with additional utility for handling messy data sets.
The implementation also includes an implementation of Adam with weight decay and 
Cosine annealing to increase training speed.
